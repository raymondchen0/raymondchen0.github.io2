New Portfolio 
Portfolio that I was working on during class can be found here **https://github.com/raymondchen0/raymondchen0.github.io-old-**

The site focuses heavily on text elements. In the elements there are pops of color to create subtle effects in what would normally be a boring / plain website. For example there are numerous hover effects. These hover effects are created with simple :hover with CSS. The images in the portfolio section also contain a subtle effect when hovered over to re-emphasize the minimal but effective use of effects to give user feedback on where and what their cursor is doing. 

The portfolio site uses both CSS and Flexbox to achieve its layout. It was designed as mobile first. However, using media queries after 700px it adjust to a new layout that more suitabaly fits that of a computer screen. Some subtle animations and actions are achieved through the use of javascript. The disapearing and reapearing banner at the top of the screen is achieved through javascript. Also the ability for smooth scrolling to top of divs is also javascript. Finally, in order to have the image modals close when a click that is outside of the image is registered is done through javascript. Most effects are css as I wanted to keep the use of javascript low to help load times.
